# Linked List (Reference Implementation)

## What is this?
A reference implementation of a doubly linked-list data structure. It 
has a simple implementation, along with a set of unit tests.

## Why is it useful?
* Reference when implementing linked lists.
* An implementation based on this can be reliably folded into libraries 
after it's used in enough projects to say it's stable.

## What parts are there?
* The LinkedList is in `LinkedList_struct.h`
* It implements using LinkedListNodes found in `LinkedListNode_struct.h`
* The unit tests are found in the `test_*` files, and can be run by 
including `test_LinkedList_struct.h` and calling 
`test_LinkedList_struct()`.
